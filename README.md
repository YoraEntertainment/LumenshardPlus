# Lumenshard+  
*A Fabric-based Modpack*

Recommended Modpack for the successor to the legendary A'therys Ascended project; Lumenshard is an MMORPG-inspired Minecraft experience boasting MMO elements, beautiful play-spaces, impressive worldbuilding, and a deep lore. During the time of A'therys Aeons, the team discovered the need to support a recommended modpack to give easy-access to necessary quality-of-life mods, the Lumenshard texture pack, and the same shaders setup we use for our official media!

**This brand new Lumenshard+ modpack offers tons of simple,  
quality-of-life changes to the vanilla Minecraft experience  
to improve user experience on the Lumenshard server (alpha coming soon!).**

**Features:**
- The official Lumenshard Resource Pack
- Xaero's Worldmap
- Xaero's Minimap (Fair-play version)
- Performance enhancements via Lithium & Sodium
- Improved graphics via Falling Leaves, Iris Shaders, LambDynamicLights, & Starlight
- And several more background features!
